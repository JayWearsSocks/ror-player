This tune is easy to pick up yet incredibly catchy. It can be played very fast.

**Sign:** form your hands into the shape of holding a telescope over one eye, then twist them slightly as if zooming in and out.

## Background
**Name:**
Antitek is a movement that critiques the use of technology as a tool for exploitation and oppression. While they oppose the misuse of technology, they firmly reject criticisms of technology that are rooted in transphobia or ableism.

**Musical background:**
Inspired by the song "Ode aux casseur/euses" by "la chorale des Canulars" from Lyon. The ode was made in reaction to the media stigmatizing so-called casseur/euses (translated as vandals, rioters. A word used by media to depoliticize anarchist and radical actions). It's an ode to the political actions of these so-called vandals, reminding us that these "violent" actions made great victories possible.

**Sign:**
The sign represents a camera lens zooming in and out.

**History:**
Antitek was created in a poorly insulated home in Lille during the 2023 French pension reform strikes, which fought against a law project raising the retirement age to 64. As of early 2025, the French state is investing in surveillance assets to break the movement and boost the propaganda for nuclear revival.
