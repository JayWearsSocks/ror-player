Rain trickling down, with 10 fingers

## Background

**Name:** Xangô (pronounced Shango) is an Orisha, a spirit in the Yoruba religion (originating from Central Africa, but making its way to South America through slavery) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shango)). Xangô is the god of lighning and thunder, known and feared for his strength and agression.

Traditional Xango ceremonial drumming are one of the influences to Afro-Brazilian music. There are quite a lot of groups and songs that have the word Xango in their name.

**Musical background:** A group called Xangó Batucada seems to play something similar to our tune ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU_GkAxMCWU), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/xangosambareggae)). *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** The tune sign is supposed to symbolize the rain in the thunder storm the rhythm is supposed to represent. The tune is to remind of the thunder, the rain and the lightning of the god (or spirit).

**History:** Part of the second round of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2004/2005.

### Meaning / Origin of Xangô

1. Religion: Its origin is the religion of the Yoruba, a Westafrican people / ethnic group connected mainly via language. It‘s believed that there is a Supreme Being known as Olorun or Olodumaré. Several gods called „powers“ are worshipped (intermediary spiritual beings, also called orixas in other religions. Every orixa is connected to a natural phenomenon, colors, food, …). Drumming, dancing and singing are used for rituals, in which for example one deity is called down to manifest by possessing a person. People seek guidance and protection by the orixas through dance, song and sacrifice, the powers are appeased and worshipped.

2. Orixa / Deity: Most popular orixa in the Yoruba-religion and the religions that derive from it. God of thunder and lightning, represents justice and wisdom, very powerful and known for his anger, his power is the main symbol of African resistance against slavery.

### Elements of Christianism in Candomblé, Shango and other African religions

During colonization, enslaved people recognized that some of the Catholic saints shared symbols and characteristics with their orixas. They began to identify some of the orixas with these saints, as a method to secretly worship their actual gods while pretending to embrace the faith of their masters. Depending on the region, orixas correspond to different saints. Xangô corresponds to Saint Barbara (she is also associated with lightning and thunder) or Saint Jerome.

In 1983, there was a conference on the orixa tradition and culture in Salvador (Bahia), when some Candomblé priest*esses proposed to do away with the Catholic elements in Candomblé (especially imagery of saints). Today it’s hotly debated whether to do this or not.

## Controversies

Since this tune is directly rooted in Afro-Brazilian religion, many people in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play it. There is an ongoing debate on whether this tune should be abandoned.
