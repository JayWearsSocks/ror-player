Scratch your head and your armpit at the same time like a monkey

## Background

**Name:** The name is inspired by a group of monkeys who frequently visited the garden of the inventor of the tune to steal things. The name of the Bongo Breaks comes from the popular Tanzanian type of music “Bongo Flava”.

**Musical background:** Uses rhythms from popular music in Tanzania.

**Sign:** The sign is related to the tune name and depicts a monkey.

**History:** Composed by someone from RoR Vienna during his time in Tanzania in 2011.

## Controversies

There is a debate about removing all monkey references from the tune name and breaks, since racist stereotypes associate monkeys with Black people (who are also often associated with drumming).

Some bands in France have decided to stop playing the Monkey Break, since racist football fans commonly make the same noises at Black players.

## About the tune

Is a very happy tune and quite new. It was introduced at the TNM 2010.

## Breaks

Break 1: It is over 16 counts and a call response. The Agogô plays part of their line and all others respond. Then
there is a part where everyone (including Agogô) plays. and in the end the Mid Surdo picks up.
