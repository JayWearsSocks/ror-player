This tune is in a Tango-like-rhythm which goes along for 8 steps/two bars.

The Surdos are the basis, the complete tune is build upon. In five of the six breaks they have a special role; in four
of them, they call the call&response-breaks (Break 1, Break 3 and the Kickbacks 1&2) and in the ‘Zorro-Break’ they are
the only ones playing, while everyone else just plays along. But also in the groove they have a special position, because
they are (except the Agogôs) the only instrument, which plays on beat. Everyone else plays offbeat, thereby the whole
tune is somehow turned into a call&response.

There’s an alternate version of the Repi groove. It sounds quite nice, but can be very tiring, not only for the
Repi players, but also for those who listen. Repi players should keep that in mind and change between alternate and
normal version.

As Hedgehog is also a Tango-like-rhythm, Ragga-Hedgehog combinations use to sound nice.

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repinique**: medium (alternate-version: hard)
* **Snare**: tricky
* **Tamborim**: medium
* **Agogô**: hard

## Breaks

* The Kick Back Breaks are a call & response between Surdos and all others. While ‘Kick Back 1’ is quite moderate,
  ‘Kick Back 2’ is quite fast. Using them as Intros, to speed up, or to create tension works really good.
* In the Kick Back 2 the Agogôs have a really hard part (playing sixteenth-notes with only one stick). It should be
  played accurate and not chaotically. Therefore it might be useful to take turns (one Agogô-player starts while another
  takes a break and e.g. after eight counts they change). Also, as a maestr@, counting in ‘Kick Back 2’ while stopping
  the Agogôs and getting them into the tune just a few bars before the next break (or getting into the tune, or
  whatever), might be helping – and increases tension and energy.
