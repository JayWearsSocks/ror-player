A nice tune based on the famous folk song “What shall we do with the drunken sailor?”. The Agogôs and Surdos together
make the melody of that song (Agogôs: “What shall we do with the drunken sailor”, Surdos in the 4th bar: “Early in the
morning”).

## Background

**Name:** “What shall we do with the drunken sailor” is a traditional sea shanty, probably originating from the US in the 1800s. The song is probably based on the traditional Irish folk song “Óró sé do bheatha abhaile” (Oh-ro welcome home), which has the same melody and was historically used by the Irish movement against the British rule. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_Sailor))

**Musical background:** The tune is based on the folk song. The Agogô line plays “What shall we do with the drunken sailor”, while the 4th bar of the Surdos plays the “early in the morning”.

**Sign:** The eye-patch depicts a pirate.

**History:** Introduced as a tune by someone from RoR Köln/Cologne in 2010.
