## Background

**Name:** Saimaannorppa or Saimaa ringed seal is an endangered animal species that only lives in one lake in Finland. They like to chill out on warm rocks. Norppas were nearly hunted to extinction in the 20th century, as it was considered an enemy to the fishing industry. Conservation began in 1979 and saved it from extinction. Since then, it has became the symbol of nature conservation in Finland. Climate change poses a direct threat to the Norppa.

**Musical background:** Song takes inspiration from the electronic music, but does not imitate any particular genre or song.
