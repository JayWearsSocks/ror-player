A very energetic tune, which sounds a lot like hip hop.

For the Surdos it might be quite hard to be in time. While they actually just have a few hits to play it’s important
for them to be synchronized. Try a memory-hook/phrase to sing along in order to remember, or just listen to the sound
files until it really sticks in your head.

Agogôs and Surdos are the ‘heart’ of this tune, try to have them as punctual as possible.

Drink from a cup formed with one hand

## Background

**Name:** Cochabamba is a major city in Bolivia. The 3rd PGA conference in 2001 was there. Social movements and direct action groups there revoked the privatization of drinking water.

**Musical background:** Break 1 and Call Break are based on the song “Iron Lion Zion” by Bob Marley ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBWFofJSm-c)). *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** Symbolizes drinking out of cup, referring to the privatization of water against which the protests happened in Cochabamba

**History:** *(More info needed.)*

## Difficulty

* **Surdos:** medium/hard
* **Tamb&Repi:** medium (they play the same, a variation of the “ragga”-snare)
* **snare:** easy
* **Agogô:** hard (but it kicks ass – if you feel lucky try clicking the bells between the (double)hits.)

## Breaks

Some breaks go for three bars (12 steps) so if one instrument plays along it’s much likely to get desynchronized.

In the Iron Lion Zion break (or break 1) everyone plays the rhythm of the Agogô with only one tone.

In the Call Break it’s the same rhythm, but this time the repi calls the four double-hits and the rest answers with two
single-hits.

There’s also the cross-kicks, a break only for the Surdos where they skip the beats in the middle of one bar. If nothing
else is mentioned everyone else continues playing.
