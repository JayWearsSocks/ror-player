A quite groovy tune that can be played slowly for a long time. The Surdos make a melody, so they are suitable to be
played by one Surdo player with three Surdos.

**Sign:** monkey, both hands in armpits

## Background

**Name:** Orangutan is a critically endangered species of apes native to south-east  Asia.

**Musical background:** *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** The sign depicts a monkey

**History:** Introduced to the network by RoR London in 2012, was probably played there before?

## Controversies

There is a debate about removing all monkey references from the tune name and breaks, since racist stereotypes associate monkeys with Black people (who are also often associated with drumming).

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: Easy
* **Repi**: Medium
* **Snare**: Medium
