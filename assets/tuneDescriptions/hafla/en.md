## Breaks

* Hafla Break/Yala break is similar to the first two counts of the Tamb line.
* Kick Back 1 Break is like the Hafla Break with alternating surdo and all-others (call-response). It is played in a
  loop, repeated over and over until something else is shown.
* Break 3 is a call response over 8 counts between Snare and all others.
* Hook Break is a bit tricky. It’s call response (Surdo to all-others) over 16 counts. There is a funny memoryhook:
  “It’s a banana, it’s not a pineapple. it’s not an aubergine or a pear. It’s a what, It’s a what, It’s a what, It’s a
  what? It’s a yellow ba-na-na.” Also really nice if repeated a few times.
