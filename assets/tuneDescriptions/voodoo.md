Unfortunately rarely played tune. Great to play for a long time, it has a kind of hypnotising effect, especially when
you start slowly and gradually speed up.

## Background

**Name:** The so-called African diaspora religions are religions that evolved from traditional African beliefs and rituals, sometimes with a Christian influence, among African slaves in America. They often had to be practiced in secret. Some of these religions are called Voodoo (sometimes spelled Vodum, Vodou, Vodú). While these religions originate in Africa, some of them (in particular Louisiana Voodoo) are also practicioned by white people. African diaspora religions usually include drumming in their rituals.

**Musical background:** It is not clear whether our tune is based on traditional Voodoo rhythms. *(More info needed.)*

**Sign:** The tune sign stands for a halo, which has been depicted above godly persons’ heads in the art of many different religions throughout history.

**History:** Part of the first set of tunes taken from Barking Bateria in 2000.

## Controversies

Since this tune is directly rooted in Afro-Brazilian religion, many people in the RoR network consider it cultural appropriation to play it. There is an ongoing debate on whether this tune should be abandoned.
