The tune is rather easy to learn, because a lot of the voices and breaks are similar to other rhythms. Also there are
kind of three groups which are each synchronized:

* Surdos playing after each other so it becomes a – quite slow – easy memorize-able melody.
* Snare & Repi play basically the same line but desynchronized → it’s possible to base the one voice on the other
* Tambs & Agogô play the same, just that the Tambs have only one possible tone while the Agogô has two.
